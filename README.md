# Britney-Spears-Silly-Web-Viz
View at your own discretion on how horrible it looks! 
But on a serious note, this is audio visualizer that's Britney Spears themed (sorta) and my first time making a project using audio
data. I tried doing the same thing in C# but failed miserably because making audio visualizers in C# is a totally normal thing 
right? WRONG! It's very difficult because there's no library providing the sound data like javascript does...so yeah. 
That project went awry and I ended up making an music player instead...haha. 
So with this you can watch the rainbow things do this...and have a background slide show that doesn't ever stop going through
the pictures...so it's pretty basic. First time using canvas doing such fancy things. A fun and terrifying experience I gotta say!

Audio is removed because sharing licensed music is illegal! So go ahead and replace it with anything :)
